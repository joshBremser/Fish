                    <Label Text="Went up to buddy's cabin on Moosehead Lake. Fished the Kennebec River (West Outlet I believe) with Fred, Matt and Alex. Water level was very high so did not have great luck, but had amazing weekend none the less. I caught 1 landlocked salmon on grey ghost and Matt caught 1 brook trout on Elk haired caddis. Other days were spent boating, tubing, hiking Mt. Kineo, and of course drinking. " HeightRequest="200"></Label>
